      "message": "oh, because the Settings list doesn\u0027t contain all the AU zones, but L246-249 adds them _if_ your locale is AU. maybe rewrite the L246 comment to something like \"all the time zones used in the user\u0027s locale, whether they\u0027re in Settings\u0027 list or not\"?\n\ni guess i\u0027m just surprised that some ambiguous time zones affect the display of _all_ time zones. i literally meant something like\n\n  if (locale.getCountry().equals(\"AU\") \u0026\u0026 TimeZoneNames.forLocale(locale).contains(olsonId)) // use examplar...\n\nthen when i read your checkin comment i thought you were going to do something cleverer where you\u0027d drop the equals(\"AU\") and just say \"if the user\u0027s country has ambiguity, avoid it\" which sounds good. but i\u0027m having trouble working out whether \"if any country has ambiguity, avoid it for all countries\" is different. i\u0027m now leaning towards it *not* being different because other countries were already using examplars, so only the user\u0027s country can be affected by this.\n\nbut that was too subtle for my little brain, so i\u0027d definitely add a comment explaining.",

      "message": "I started by special casing \"AU\" but as mentioned I didn\u0027t like the special casing. The rule will apply where there\u0027s ambiguity, and AU triggers that.\n\n246-249 has no effect on the final list. We always output all entries we were told to by the config. The only question is whether we display the \"long name\" or the \"exemplar location\" for the local olsonIds.\n\nAgree the logic below is confusing. I think because \"use  location\" is actually the common/default case.\n\nThe way I thought about it was:\n\nexemplar location used when: \"olsonId is non local\" OR (\"olson id is local\" (implied) AND longNamesAreAmbiguous)\n\nI flipped the order of the preferLocationDisplayName check because the longNamesAreAmbiguous check is cheapest. Most cases it *will* be false, though so we\u0027ll fall through to \"is local\". It should still mean that the only time we use the long name is when the timezone is local AND long names ARE NOT ambiguous.\n\nI\u0027ll look at making it clearer.",
