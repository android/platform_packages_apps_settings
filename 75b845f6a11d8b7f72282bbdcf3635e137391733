Would timing be an issue ?\n\nValue within carrier config would be changed based on subscription(SIM).\nHowever, it should be altered after a latency (that\u0027s to say, a few milli-seconds after subscriptionId appears).\n\nCould this be an issue if carrier config string only read within init() ?\n\n2. Would activity re-create be an issue ?\n\nFor the case of activity re-create, values within memory has better saved to instances.\nOtherwise, reload would be required.\n\nCould this be an issue if carrier config string only read within init() ?",
