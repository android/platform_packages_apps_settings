      "message": "I think that should have been commented.\n\nWe\u0027re into edge cases here so I\u0027m going to say the behavior here is whatever we want to make it, and I think simple code is better. The old code would add null to the regionIds, which worked but wasn\u0027t exactly expected.\n\nAIUI, the important thing for shownInPicker is that we don\u0027t show it when the user selects the region. That\u0027s still the case with this change if my testing is to be believed.\n\nIf the device is already set to a zone when we make it \"shownInPicker\u003dn\" (or however the device ended up set to a now \"hidden\" or \"unused\" zone ID), I\u0027m ok with it showing the region the zone is associated with in our data, as opposed to USA (which is what it does today).",

      "message": "yeah. i agree null region id needs to be fixed.\n\n\u003e I think that should have been commented.\nah. sorry for no comment here. But I think it\u0027s tested. Perhaps, you can try to run the test and see if it passes?\nhttps://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/apps/Settings/tests/unit/src/com/android/settings/datetime/timezone/model/TimeZoneDataTest.java?q\u003dTimeZoneDataTest\n\nI think the USA comes from the country in the en_US locale, as I think this default was mostly designed for the case when the phone started with no network signal and no time zone at all. I can\u0027t remember the exact details, but. I think the default region of hidden zone can be discussed and get fixed if the default from locale is problematic.",
