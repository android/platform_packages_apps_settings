      "message": "Yes, agreed this is not ideal.  But due to the fact that everything in the Settings is centered around AccessPoint objects, together with the fact that I am not really familiar with the Settings code, makes it difficult for me to come up other simple approaches.  So basically I am trying to make the simplest code change to achieve the goal :)\n\nI am open to other approaches if you have any suggestions.",
