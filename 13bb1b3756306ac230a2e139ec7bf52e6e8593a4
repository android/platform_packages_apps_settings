The user dictionary is a fundamental part of the system and it *must* contain a LOCALE column as far as I\u0027m aware; I don\u0027t see how the bug that you are trying to fix could happen on a compliant device. If the device does not have a LOCALE column in the user dictionary, it won\u0027t work as expected with most IMEs and should be fixed.\n\nIn which cases do you see this happen?",
