      "message": "Both KEY_UNLOCK_SET_NONE \u0026 KEY_UNLOCK_SET_OFF are mapped to PASSWORD_QUALITY_UNSPECIFIED. However, as described in the CL description, this is a behavioral difference. \n\nThe default screen lock on a Pixel device is KEY_UNLOCK_SET_NONE (Swipe to unlock) instead of KEY_UNLOCK_SET_OFF. If the intention of this CL is to restore the previous lock screen before the CTS test is run, I am unsure this is the right approach. Jeff, what do you think?",
