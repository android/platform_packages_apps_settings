      "message": "I rationalized this with the following thoughts.\n\nThis marker is in a series of translatable strings. We are setting policy here that the smallest log buffer size we will set is 65536. Problem is I would be tempted to use it above in defaultLogdSizeValue which is a separate policy that is written to match what logd actually has built-in. Abstracting them into values above (1000 lines above no less) bothers me, I feel like I want these close at hand.",
