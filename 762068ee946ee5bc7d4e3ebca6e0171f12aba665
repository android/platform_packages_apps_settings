      "message": "Thank you for your review. I forgot to check destroy logic. In that case, I prefer to move closing session to onDestroyView because simply opening session at onCreate would make another issue.\n\nIf ethernet is really present and there was no data usage so far, mShowEthernet would be set to false at the onCreate. However, if a user connect ethernet afterwards and resume this view, user would experience the same issue because mShowEthernet variable is checked along with hasEthernet() to determine whether to show ethernet related UIs (context menu and tab).\n\nHow do you think? Best way to fix this issue would be creating hardware feature for ethernet and check it instead but we don\u0027t.",

      "message": "thinking about this a bit more, could we just have that \"override preferences when no mobile radio\" if() block in onCreate() set both mShowWifi and mShowEthernet to true?  as you pointed out, we always check against hasEthernet() later before actually showing any UI.\n\nthat should handle the resume-after-traffic case you pointed out.\n\nbtw it shouldn\u0027t be a hardware feature, since network connections can come/go.  for example, consider a USB ethernet adapter that is transient.",
